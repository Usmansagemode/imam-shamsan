## Managing Your Website Content

Once the website is built, you will manage content through **two tools**:
- **Notion** — for all text content, metadata, and links
- **Cloudinary** — for uploading photos and images

Your website has **7 Notion databases**:

| Database           | What It Controls                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Articles           | Writings/articles on the Writings page              |
| Services           | Services listed on the Services page                |
| Sermon Summaries   | Written khutbah summaries on the Sermons page       |
| Gallery            | Individual photos on the Gallery page               |
| Recitations        | Qur'anic recitation videos on the Media page        |
| About Page         | Your biography, education, and background           |
| Site Settings      | Live stream URL, profile image, logo                |

### Arabic & English

Notion fully supports Arabic on the free plan. You can write in Arabic, English, or both in the same page — just type naturally. The website will automatically detect the language direction for each paragraph:
- Arabic paragraphs will display right-to-left
- English paragraphs will display left-to-right
- You do not need to do anything special — just write normally

---

### Adding & Editing Writings (Articles)

The Writings section shows your articles, reflections, and Islamic knowledge pieces. You write the full content directly inside each Notion page.

**To add a new article:**
1. Open Notion and go to the **"Articles"** database
2. Click **"+ New"** at the bottom of the table to create a new entry
3. Fill in the properties at the top of the page:

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `live_stream_url`   | YouTube link shown on the homepage and Media page         |
| `live_stream_title` | Title displayed above the live stream (e.g., "Friday Khutbah - Week of Feb 14") |
| `profile_img`       | Your profile photo shown on the About page                |
| `logo`              | The logo displayed in the website header                  |

### Uploading Images to Cloudinary

**To upload photos:**
1. Log in to Cloudinary at [https://console.cloudinary.com](https://console.cloudinary.com)
2. Click **"Media Library"** in the left sidebar
3. Click the **"Upload"** button (top-right)
4. Drag and drop your photos, or click to browse your computer
5. Click **"Upload"** to confirm

**To get an image URL (for pasting into Notion):**
1. In the Media Library, click on any image
2. Click the **link/chain icon** or look for **"Copy URL"**
3. Paste this URL into the relevant Notion property or page body

**Tips for photos:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Landscape orientation (horizontal) works best for galleries and cover images
- Photos are automatically optimized — no need to resize before uploading
- Give photos descriptive names before uploading (e.g., `eid-prayer-hall.jpg` instead of `IMG_4523.jpg`)

**Important:** When adding images inside a Notion page body (writings or sermons), always use **"Embed link"** and paste a **Cloudinary URL**. Never use Notion's "Upload" option — uploaded images break after 1 hour.
